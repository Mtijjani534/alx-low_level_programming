 C - Recursion
0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget (0-puts recursion.c). Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together(1-print-rev-recursion.c). Write a function that prints a string in reverse.
2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange (2-strlen-recursion.c). Write a function that returns the length of a string.
3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling (3-factorial.c).Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.
- Prototype: int factorial(int n);
- If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error
- Factorial of 0 is 1
4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate](4-pow-recursion.c)
Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
- Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);
- If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1.
5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer](5-sqrt-recursion.c)
Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.
- Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n);
- If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1.
6. Inception. Is it possible?](6-is-prime-number.c)
Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
- Prototype: int is-prime-number(int n);
7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything](100-is-palindrome.c)
Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
- Prototype: int is-palindrome(char *s);
- An empty string is a palindrome
8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...](101-wildcmp.c)
Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
- Prototype: int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
- s2 can contain the special character *.
- The special char * can replace any string (including an empty string)
